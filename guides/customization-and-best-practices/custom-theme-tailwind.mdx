- Maintaining consistent, responsive, and accessible design

### Prerequisites
- A working Dory project with development setup complete
- Familiarity with Tailwind CSS basics (class utilities, configuration)
- Access to your project’s root folder and ability to edit `tailwind.config.js` and stylesheets

### Outcome
By following this guide, your documentation will reflect your brand’s personality and improve readability and user engagement through tailored visual presentation.

## 2. Customization Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Locate Tailwind Configuration">
Your Tailwind settings reside in `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts` in the project root. This file controls global theme options like colors, fonts, breakpoints, and plugins.

1. Open `tailwind.config.js`.
2. Review the existing theme overrides under the `theme` key.

> Example snippet:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#1D4ED8',
        secondary: '#9333EA',
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This controls default blue and purple colors and uses the Inter font.

</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Add or Modify Theme Colors">
Tailor your color palette by extending or overriding colors.

- Add brand colors under `extend.colors`
- Use hex, RGB, or CSS color names

> Example:
```js
extend: {
  colors: {
    brandBlue: '#0055FF',
    brandOrange: '#FF7700',
  },
},
```

Use these in your MDX or components as utility classes like `text-brandBlue` or `bg-brandOrange`.

Verify by running the dev server (`pnpm run dev`) and opening your site.

</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Customize Typography">
Modify typography for better branding or readability.

- Add new fonts in `fontFamily`
- Adjust font sizes, weights, line heights in the `theme.extend.typography` block (if using a typography plugin)

For example, to use Google Fonts, add the font link in your `index.html` or via component:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
Then update your config:
```js
fontFamily: {
  sans: ['Roboto', 'sans-serif'],
},
```
Tailwind utilities like `font-sans`, `text-lg`, and `leading-relaxed` can then be used consistently.

</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Override Component Styles">
Dory uses SCSS along with Tailwind. You can override component styles by:

- Editing `src/theme.scss` or adding a new style file
- Using Tailwind’s `@apply` directive in SCSS for utility composition

Example to change sidebar link color and hover:
```scss
.sidebar-link {
  @apply text-brandBlue hover:text-brandOrange;
}
```
This applies your new theme colors easily.

You can also extend or create custom utility classes for spacing, shadows, rounded corners, etc.

</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Apply Dark Mode Customizations">
Dory supports dark mode using Tailwind’s dark variant.

Customize colors in dark mode by extending your config:
```js
extend: {
  colors: {
    darkBg: '#121212',
    darkText: '#E5E5E5',
  },
},
```
Use `.dark` prefix for your CSS classes, e.g., `dark:bg-darkBg dark:text-darkText`.

Check the site by toggling dark mode to ensure the colors look consistent and readable.

</Step>
<Step title="Step 6: Rebuild and Preview">
After making changes:
1. Save your config and CSS/SCSS files.
2. Run or restart the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
3. Open your docs site (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
4. Confirm your visual changes are correctly applied.

If you use the production build:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

This validates final styling before deployment.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example: Change Primary Color and Font

Modify `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#FF4500', // Bright orange
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['"Open Sans"', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Add Open Sans font to your HTML header or via custom component:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Use `text-primary` in your markdown or components to style headings and links.

### Example: Customize Sidebar Link Hover

In `src/theme.scss`:

```scss
.sidebar-link:hover {
  @apply text-primary underline;
}
```

This changes sidebar navigation links to your primary brand color on hover with an underline for improved feedback.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Tips & Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Why don't my Tailwind classes update after changes?">
Ensure you have restarted the development server to pick up changes in `tailwind.config.js`.
If using caching, try clearing `.vite` or `node_modules/.cache` folders.
Check your IDE for any syntax errors in the config file.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to add custom fonts properly?">
Load fonts via `<link>` tags in the root HTML or your main layout component.
Make sure font family names match those used in Tailwind config.
Use browser developer tools to verify font loading.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Best practices for color contrast?">
Always check your text and background colors meet accessibility contrast requirements.
Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
Define separate colors for light and dark modes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I add custom Tailwind plugins?">
Yes, you can extend Tailwind by adding plugins in `tailwind.config.js` under `plugins`.
Examples include typography, forms, or custom utility plugins.
