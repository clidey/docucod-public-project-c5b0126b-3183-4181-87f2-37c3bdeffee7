# Endpoints & Operations

Explore all available REST API operations with detailed method definitions, input and output schemas, plus real-world usage examples. This page empowers you to interact directly with the API through our integrated 'Try It' playgrounds, supporting GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for hands-on testing.

---

## Overview

The Endpoints & Operations page serves as your central hub for discovering every REST API endpoint offered by the platform. Each API operation is presented with clear explanations, required parameters, request and response structures, and linked sample requests and responses.

This practical view not only documents but enables you to validate functionality in real time, accelerating your development workflow with immediate feedback.

---

## API Interface and Base Configuration

- **Base URL:** All REST API endpoints are accessed under the base URL `https://api.example.com/v1`.
- **Authentication:** Each endpoint requires an API key passed in the HTTP header `X-API-Key` (see Authentication & Authorization guide for details).
- **Content Type:** Requests and responses primarily utilize JSON (`application/json`).
- **Endpoints Covered:** `GET /products`, `POST /products`, `GET /products/{id}`, `PUT /products/{id}`, `DELETE /products/{id}`.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

The API secures all operations using API Key authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header for every request. Without valid authentication, endpoints will return a `401 Unauthorized` response.

For usage examples, token management, and security best practices, please refer to the [Authentication & Authorization](https://docs.example.com/api-reference/rest-api/rest-authentication) documentation.

## API Playground – Interactive Exploration

Every endpoint on this page is paired with an interactive playground where you can configure request parameters, headers, and body (if applicable), then execute live API calls directly from your browser.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Request Setup:** Modify query parameters, path variables, request headers, and JSON payloads.
- **Authentication Support:** Easily select and provide your API key or other supported authentication credentials.
- **Real-Time Response:** View full HTTP response details including status codes, headers, and formatted JSON data.
- **Request Timing:** Understand API responsiveness by viewing request duration.
- **Error Feedback:** Clear, detailed messages help troubleshoot failed requests.

#### Example: Try Listing Products

Use the playground's GET `/products` interface, set `page` to 1, `limit` to 5, and filter by category "electronics". Click **Send Request** to see live data instantly.

<APIPlayground
  method="GET"
  url="/products"
  title="List Products"
  description="Retrieve paginated products with optional filters"
  parameters={[
    { name: "page", type: "number", description: "Page number for pagination", defaultValue: "1" },
    { name: "limit", type: "number", description: "Items per page", defaultValue: "10" },
    { name: "category", type: "string", description: "Filter by category" }
  ]}
  authType="apiKey"
  servers={[{ url: "https://api.example.com/v1", description: "Production server" }]}
/>

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Ensure API key is current and valid** before making requests to avoid authentication errors.
- **Use pagination parameters** (`page` and `limit`) to manage large data sets effectively.
- **Validate JSON body structure** in create and update requests to prevent `400 Bad Request` errors.
- **Leverage the playground** to iterate on queries quickly before integrating calls into your code.
- **Handle `404 Not Found` gracefully** by confirming correct product IDs.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Unauthorized (401) Errors:** Double-check your `X-API-Key` header value, ensure no extra spaces, and verify key permissions.
- **Bad Request (400) Errors:** Check JSON payload for syntax errors or missing required fields (`name`, `price`, `category`).
- **Timeouts or Slow Responses:** Use pagination to request smaller data slices and monitor network stability.
