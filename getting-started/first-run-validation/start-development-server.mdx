# Run the Development Server

This guide helps you start the Dory development server for real-time editing and preview of your documentation site. By following these steps, you’ll launch a local server that instantly updates your docs as you edit them, enabling a fast, interactive authoring experience.

---

## 1. Prerequisites for Running the Dev Server

Before you start, ensure you have completed the following setup tasks:

- **Project Setup:** You have cloned or created a documentation project with a valid `docs` directory containing your `.mdx` files.
- **Dependency Installation:** You have run `pnpm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
- **Navigate to Project Root:** Your terminal is positioned at the root of your Dory project (where `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` reside).

> If you haven’t set up your project yet, refer to the [Initialize Your Documentation Project](../project-setup/create-project) guide.

---

## 2. Starting the Development Server

Follow these exact steps to launch the development server:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your terminal at the project root">
Ensure your terminal working directory contains `package.json` and the `docs/` folder.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the development command">
Execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This runs the development server with hot reload, usually powered by Vite.
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for server to start">
You will see output similar to:

```text
  VITE vX.Y.Z  ready in 300ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

This confirms the server is running and the URL where you can preview your documentation.
</Step>
<Step title="Open the local URL in your browser">
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` (or the URL shown in your terminal). You should see your documentation site loaded and ready.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 3. What Happens When the Dev Server is Running

- **Live Hot Reload:** Any changes saved in your `.mdx` files inside `docs/` refresh the browser automatically.
- **Dynamic Frontmatter & Navigation:** The dev server continuously updates generated files such as `frontmatter.json` and serves them dynamically.
- **Native MDX Rendering:** Your MDX content renders with live components and styling powered by Preact and Tailwind CSS.
- **Access to Full Navigation:** The site reflects the `dory.json` configured navigation structure immediately.

---

## 4. Verifying Your Local Documentation Site

To confirm your documentation server is fully operational:

- Open the browser console (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and check for errors. The absence of errors indicates a healthy build.
- Confirm navigation tabs and groups match your `dory.json` configuration.
- Edit an `.mdx` file in your `docs/` folder and save it — the page should update instantly in your browser.
- Verify special features such as Mermaid diagrams, code highlighting, and LaTeX math render as expected.

---

## 5. Helpful Tips & Common Pitfalls

<Tip>
If the dev server does not start or you see errors, check:

- Have you installed dependencies with `pnpm install`?
- Is your Node.js version compatible? (See [System Requirements](../prerequisites-installation/system-requirements))
- Are you in the correct folder path?
- Confirm no other process is using port 3000 (use commands like `lsof -i :3000`).
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use the flag `--host` with `pnpm run dev` if you want to expose your server on the local network:

```bash
pnpm run dev -- --host
```

This allows others on your network to preview your docs.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Make sure your `docs/` folder contains valid `.mdx` files and a well-formed `dory.json` configuration, or the site may not load correctly.
</Warning>

## 6. Next Steps After Running the Development Server

- Begin editing your documentation content live.
- Sync your `dory.json` navigation file to organize pages.
- When ready, build a static production version by running:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

- Preview the static site locally using:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

- To deploy, use any static hosting provider or Docker (refer to the Docker deployment guides).

## 7. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Development Server Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Port is Already in Use">
If you see an error about port 3000 being taken:

- Find process using port:

```bash
lsof -i :3000
```

- Kill the process:

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

- Restart the dev server.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dependencies Not Installed or Missing">
Ensure you are using `pnpm` and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Avoid mixing with `npm` or `yarn` to prevent conflicts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Output or Blank Page in Browser">
Check the browser console for errors.

Verify your `docs/` folder contains valid MDX content and `dory.json` is proper.

Run the dev server with verbosity if needed to trace problems.
