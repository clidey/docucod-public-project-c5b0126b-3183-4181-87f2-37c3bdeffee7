# Initialize Your Documentation Project

This guide helps you successfully clone the Dory repository (or set up a new documentation project from scratch), create or copy the essential `docs` directory, and verify the correct project structure. Having the right scaffolding is crucial for smooth builds and development.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository or Create a New Project

Start by obtaining the project codebase. You can either clone the official Dory repository or create your own documentation project following the same structure.

### To clone the official Dory repo:

```bash
# Navigate to your working folder
git clone https://github.com/clidey/dory.git
cd dory
```

### To create a new project from scratch:

- Initialize an empty project directory.
- You will add configuration and docs directories manually (covered below).

---

## 2. Ensure the `docs` Directory Exists

The `docs` directory is the core content folder where all your documentation MDX files live. This directory must be present at the root of your project for Dory to detect your docs.

### If cloning the repo:

- The `docs` directory is already included.
- It contains sample documentation to help you get started.

### If setting up manually:

- Create a `docs` directory at your project root:

```bash
mkdir docs
```

- Add your `.mdx` files inside this directory.

- The files should follow the structure and naming conventions that map to the navigation hierarchy defined in your `dory.json`.

---

## 3. Create or Copy the `dory.json` Configuration File

The `dory.json` file configures your documentation site, including navigation tabs, groups, and page ordering.

- This file MUST be in the root of your `docs` directory.

- Clone users will already have this configured.

- New projects should create this file by referencing the sample in the cloned repo or [see Configure Dory](../configure-dory).

---

## 4. Verify Project Structure

Make sure your project folder looks like this:

```plaintext
/dory-project-root
  ├── docs/
  │    ├── index.mdx
  │    ├── getting-started/
  │    │    ├── prerequisites-installation/
  │    │    │    ├── system-requirements.mdx
  │    │    │    ├── install-cli.mdx
  │    │    │    └── install-docker.mdx
  │    │    ├── project-setup/
  │    │    │    ├── create-project.mdx  <-- this page
  │    │    │    ├── configure-dory.mdx
  │    │    │    └── add-docs.mdx
  │    │    └── first-run-validation/
  │    │         ├── ...
  │    ├── overview/
  │    │    └── ...
  │    └── ...
  ├── dory.json
  ├── package.json
  ├── pnpm-lock.yaml
  ├── tsconfig.app.json
  └── vite.config.ts
```

### Key Checks:

- `docs/` folder exists and contains `.mdx` files following proper hierarchy.
- `dory.json` is present and valid.
- Configuration files like `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and `tsconfig.app.json` exist in the root.

---

## 5. Verify Your Setup

After cloning or creating the project and verifying structure, confirm everything is set up correctly before building.

### Steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. **Check `docs` directory and `dory.json`:**

```bash
ls -l docs
cat docs/dory.json
```

3. **Run build to verify scaffolding:**

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> The build should complete successfully without errors related to missing docs or config.

---

## Practical Tips

- Do not rename or move the `docs` folder; Dory expects it in the root.

- The `dory.json` navigation order determines how your pages are displayed; make sure it maps accurately to your `.mdx` files.

- Use lowercase URLs and paths consistently.

- If working with Git, ensure you `git pull` latest changes before starting.

- Use pnpm for dependency management; avoid npm or yarn to prevent conflicts.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Missing `docs` Directory or `dory.json` File">
If the build or CLI commands complain about missing files:
- Verify you are in the correct project root.
- Confirm the `docs` directory exists and contains `.mdx` files.
- Ensure `dory.json` is at the root.
- Run `ls` or `dir` commands to inspect.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Invalid `dory.json`">
- Check your `dory.json` formatting for syntax errors.
- Validate JSON structure matches navigation schema.
- Use JSON linters or editors that highlight errors.
- Refer to the [Configure Dory](../configure-dory) guide for examples.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependencies or PNPM Issues">
- Run `pnpm install` to refresh dependencies.
- Delete `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` and reinstall if errors persist.
- Confirm your Node.js version meets requirements ([see System Requirements](../prerequisites-installation/system-requirements)).
</Accordion>

## Summary

This page established the foundation by helping you clone or create your documentation project, set up the `docs` directory, place your MDX content appropriately, and verify your project structure for a successful build and development.

To progress:

- Configure your documentation site in `dory.json` ([Configure Dory](../configure-dory))
- Add and structure content within `docs` ([Add & Structure Documentation Content](../add-docs))
- Start the development server to preview your docs ([Run the Development Server](../first-run-validation/start-development-server))

<Tip>
Having the correct `docs` directory with a valid `dory.json` configuration, and following the project's scaffolding precisely, is essential to unlock the full power of Dory's static site generation and live preview features.
