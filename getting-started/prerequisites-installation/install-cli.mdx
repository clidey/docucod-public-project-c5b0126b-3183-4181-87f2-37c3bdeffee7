# Installing the CLI

This guide walks you through installing the Dory CLI globally using npm, enabling you to run the `dory` command from any location on your system quickly and effortlessly. Whether you’re on Windows, macOS, or Linux, follow the steps below for a smooth installation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure your system meets the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or newer is required. To verify, run:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Verify with:

  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

- **Internet Connection**: Required to download the CLI from the npm registry.

> If you do not have Node.js installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).


## 2. Installing Dory CLI Globally

Installing the CLI globally allows you to access the `dory` command from anywhere in your terminal.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run npm install command">
Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following:

```bash
npm install -g @clidey/dory
```

This command downloads and installs Dory version `0.20.0` (or the latest) globally.

</Step>
<Step title="Confirm CLI installation">
After installation completes, verify the CLI is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
dory --version
```

You should see the installed Dory CLI version number, confirming the installation.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>

If you encounter permission errors on Linux or macOS, try running the install command with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @clidey/dory
```

Alternatively, consider using a Node.js version manager like `nvm` to manage global packages without `sudo`.
</Note>

## 3. Platform-Specific Considerations

### Windows

- Make sure your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal) is running with administrator privileges if permission issues arise.
- Restart your terminal after installation to refresh PATH environment variables.

### macOS & Linux

- Verify that npm's global bin directory is in your PATH environment variable. You can check by running:

  ```bash
echo $PATH
```

- If `dory` command is not recognized after installation, add npm global bin path to your shell configuration (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(npm bin -g)"
  ```

  Then restart your terminal.

## 4. Verifying the Installation

To confirm everything is working flawlessly:

1. Run this command to get the help menu:

   ```bash
   dory help
   ```

2. You should see a list of available commands including `build`, `preview`, and `help` alongside their descriptions.

3. Running `dory --version` should display the installed CLI version.

This confirms you have full access to the Dory CLI.

## 5. Next Steps: Running Dory CLI

Now that you have Dory installed globally, here’s how to begin:

- **Build your docs site:**

  ```bash
  dory build
  ```

- **Preview the build locally:**

  ```bash
  dory preview
  ```

- **View help anytime:**

  ```bash
  dory help
  ```

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
If your install fails with permission errors:

- Try using `sudo` on macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g @clidey/dory
  ```

- Or configure npm to use a different global directory:

  1. Create a directory for global packages:

     ```bash
     mkdir ~/.npm-global
     ```

  2. Configure npm to use the new directory:

     ```bash
     npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
     ```

  3. Add this directory to your PATH in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

     ```bash
     export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
     ```

  4. Reload your shell and retry installation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Command Not Found After Installation">
- Ensure the npm global bin directory is in your PATH.
- On Unix shells, add the following if missing:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(npm bin -g)"
  ```

- Restart your terminal for changes to take effect.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network or Registry Errors">
- Check your internet connection.
- If behind a corporate proxy, configure npm to use your proxy settings:

  ```bash
  npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
  npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
  ```

- Try clearing the npm cache:

  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  ```

- Retry installation afterward.
