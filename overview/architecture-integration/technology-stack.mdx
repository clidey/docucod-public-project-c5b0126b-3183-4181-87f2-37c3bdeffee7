# Technology Stack

## Unlocking Performance and Developer Experience

Dory is powered by a carefully selected set of modern, proven technologies that ensure blazing-fast builds, intuitive development workflows, and a superior user experience. This page breaks down the core frameworks and libraries that make Dory a lightweight yet powerful static site generator designed specifically for technical documentation.

Whether you are a developer aiming to customize Dory or an engineering lead evaluating Dory for your team, understanding these foundational technologies reveals why Dory achieves speed, flexibility, and portability without compromising on features.

## Core Technologies

### 1. Preact — A Lightweight React-Compatible UI Library

Dory leverages Preact for its UI layer—a minimal, high-performance alternative to React that shares the same modern API but with a much smaller footprint.

- **Why Preact?**
  - Delivers fast initial page loads due to its tiny bundle size
  - Enables full React compatibility, allowing use of React tooling and hooks
  - Facilitates smooth client-side interactivity with minimal runtime overhead

> This directly benefits your docs by making the site fast and snappy for users, even on low-powered devices or slow networks.

### 2. Vite — Next-Generation Build Tool

At the heart of Dory’s build process is Vite, a cutting-edge build tool focused on providing an unmatchable developer experience with rapid hot module replacement (HMR) and lightning-fast builds.

- **Key contributions to Dory:**
  - Instant hot reload during documentation writing for real-time feedback
  - Seamless integration with Preact and MDX files
  - Support for custom plugins powering advanced content preprocessing and sanitization

### 3. Tailwind CSS — Utility-First Styling Framework

Tailwind CSS powers Dory’s design system, enabling styles to be defined declaratively through utility classes.

- **Benefits for users:**
  - Consistent, responsive, and customizable UI without repetitive CSS
  - Easy theming and overrides thanks to Tailwind’s design tokens
  - Maintains minimal CSS bundle size by purging unused styles in production

### 4. Mermaid — Dynamic Diagram Rendering

Documentation often demands visual explanations; Dory integrates Mermaid to enable easy creation of flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more within Markdown content.

- **Why Mermaid matters:**
  - Converts simple text syntax into dynamic SVG diagrams
  - Embeds directly inside MDX without external dependencies
  - Enhances comprehension through visual storytelling

### 5. TypeScript — Strictly Typed Superset of JavaScript

Developed entirely with TypeScript, Dory offers a robust codebase with strict typing, improving maintainability and reducing runtime errors.

- **Developer advantages:**
  - Comprehensive type safety throughout the project
  - Modern JavaScript features with backward compatibility ensured by config
  - Better editor support and autocompletion during development

## How These Technologies Work Together

Dory’s static site generator processes your `.mdx` files through Vite’s build pipeline enhanced by custom plugins, converting rich Markdown with interactive components and Mermaid diagrams into optimized static bundles. Preact takes over at runtime, delivering a smooth client-side experience. Tailwind controls styling throughout for a modern, clean visual system.

This stack ensures incremental live editing during development and highly efficient static builds for production, maintaining top-notch performance and flexibility.

## Real-World Scenario: Writing and Previewing Docs

Imagine you’re documenting a complex API:

1. You write your content in `.mdx` with embedded Mermaid diagrams.
2. Vite instantly hot-reloads the docs, showing updates live.
3. Preact re-renders components smoothly without full page reloads.
4. Tailwind ensures your docs look professional and consistent.
5. When ready, the build produces a lightweight, fully static site deployable anywhere.

The result is a delightful editing experience paired with a fast, reliable, and portable documentation website.

---

## Practical Tips

- Customize styles easily by modifying Tailwind configuration or extending utility classes.
- Use Preact hooks carefully for stateful components to keep your documentation interactive and minimal.
- Leverage Vite’s plugin system to add or adjust content preprocessing tailored to your documentation needs.
- Include Mermaid diagrams to clarify workflows and relationships without complex setup.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If the development server does not hot reload as expected, ensure your `.mdx` files are within the configured source folders.
- Styling quirks often come from conflicting Tailwind classes; audit class usage or check your theme overrides.
- Mermaid diagrams require valid syntax; validate your Mermaid code if diagrams aren’t rendering.
- Strict TypeScript settings might flag unused code; keep your imports and components clean.
