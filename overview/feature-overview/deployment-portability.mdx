# Deployment & Portability

## Deliver Your Documentation Anywhere, Effortlessly

Dory empowers you to build your technical documentation once—and deploy it anywhere you need. Designed as a fully static site generator, it ensures your docs remain lightning-fast, portable, and free from vendor lock-in.

Whether your team prefers modern cloud platforms or traditional static hosting, Dory seamlessly fits into your workflow with zero friction.

---

## Why Dory’s Deployment Model Matters

Today’s documentation workflows demand flexibility and speed. Dory’s static architecture means your documentation is pre-built into optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be hosted virtually anywhere—without needing server-side rendering or complex backend infrastructure.

This flexibility lets you:

- Use any popular static hosting service or custom server
- Avoid vendor lock-in and costly migrations
- Ensure fast loading times with static assets
- Simplify CI/CD pipelines through consistent builds


---

## Supported Deployment Targets

Dory caters to various deployment preferences out-of-the-box, empowering you to deliver your documentation where it fits best.

### 1. Netlify

One of the most popular static deployment platforms, Netlify offers seamless Git integration and continuous deployment out of the box.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic builds triggered on Git pushes
- Built-in HTTPS, global CDN, and cache optimization
- Simple drag-and-drop deployment for static folders

**How to deploy:**
Push your repository to GitHub or GitLab, connect Netlify to your repo, and configure the build command `dory build` and publish directory `dist`.

### 2. Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend deployment with support for static sites and serverless functions.

**Benefits:**
- Zero-configuration deployment for static sites
- Instant cache invalidation and preview URLs
- Git integration and analytics

**How to deploy:**
Link your Git repository, set build command to `dory build`, and specify the output directory `dist` for hosting.

### 3. Amazon S3 + CloudFront

For teams with AWS infrastructure, deploying to an S3 bucket combined with CloudFront CDN offers scalable, cost-effective hosting.

**Benefits:**
- Full control over storage, security, and caching
- Global content delivery with CloudFront
- Integration with existing AWS workflows

**How to deploy:**
Build your site locally with `dory build`, then sync the `dist` directory to your S3 bucket using AWS CLI or CI/CD tools.

### 4. GitHub Pages

Host directly from your Git repository with GitHub’s native Pages service.

**Benefits:**
- Free static hosting for public repositories
- Automatic site generation from specific branches or folders
- Supports custom domains

**How to deploy:**
Push your built `dist` folder content to the `gh-pages` branch, or configure GitHub Actions to automate the build and deploy steps.

### 5. Docker / Nginx

Use containerization for consistent deployments across environments.

**Benefits:**
- Encapsulated static server with Nginx or other static servers
- Easy to integrate with existing container orchestration tools
- Replicable local and production setups

**How to deploy:**
Build your static site using `dory build`, then serve the `dist` folder with a Docker container running Nginx. An example Dockerfile is provided to get started quickly.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

You can build and run this container locally:

```bash
docker build -t dory-docs .
docker run -p 8080:80 dory-docs
```

Access your docs at `http://localhost:8080`.

## The Static Nature of Dory Sites

Dory exclusively generates fully static websites. This has significant benefits:

- **No backend dependencies:** No need for Node.js, databases, or dynamic servers in production.
- **Speed:** Static files load instantly from CDNs or edge caches.
- **Security:** Minimizes attack surface as there is no runtime logic.
- **Portability:** Move your site between providers or servers without compatibility issues.

The output of `dory build` is a self-contained `dist` directory, including all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and assets. You can deploy this directory as-is.

<Info>
If your documentation requires dynamic elements (search, navigation, etc.), these run client-side in the browser without needing server infrastructure.
</Info>

## Best Practices for Deployment

### Build Consistency

Always run `dory build` in your CI/CD pipelines or local machines to create a consistent snapshot of your docs. Avoid manually modifying files inside the `dist` directory.

### Asset Cache Control

Leverage HTTP caching wisely to balance fast load times with content freshness. Set appropriate cache headers depending on your hosting platform.

### Continuous Deployment

Configure automatic deployment pipelines using Git-based workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Netlify/Vercel native hooks) to streamline publishing updates.

### Docker Use Cases

Use Docker primarily for environments where replicable builds and isolated serving environments are critical, such as corporate intranets or complex cloud setups.

## Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Deployment Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Site Not Updating After Deployment">

Ensure you successfully ran `dory build` before deployment. Verify that your hosting platform points to the correct directory (usually `dist`). Also, clear CDN caches if necessary.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Broken Links or Navigation Problems">

Check your `dory.json` configuration for accurate paths and routing. Confirm all relevant `.mdx` files are included and no typos affect navigation.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Search or Interactive Features Not Working">

Remember that Dory’s search functions run client-side. Make sure the built site includes the prebuilt search index and that JavaScript is enabled in browser.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Docker Container Fails to Serve Site">

Confirm that the build step completed without errors, and the `dist` folder is correctly copied into the container image. Also, ensure Nginx is properly configured to serve static files.

## Getting Started with Deployment

To deploy your Dory documentation site:

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Build your static site">
Run the build command to generate static assets:

```bash
dory build
```
</Step>
<Step title="2. Choose your hosting platform">
Select from supported hosts like Netlify, Vercel, S3, GitHub Pages, or Docker.
</Step>
<Step title="3. Deploy the static `dist` folder">
Upload or push your `dist` directory contents according to your chosen platform’s workflow.
</Step>
