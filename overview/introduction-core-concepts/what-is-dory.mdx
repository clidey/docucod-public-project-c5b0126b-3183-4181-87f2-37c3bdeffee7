# What is Dory?

## Introduction

Dory is a lightweight static site generator designed specifically for technical documentation. It empowers developers and documentation teams to quickly deploy clean, fast, and customizable documentation sites without the usual complexity of server-side rendering or elaborate CI/CD pipelines.

Unlike bulky, general-purpose static site generators, Dory offers a streamlined workflow centered entirely on documentation. It elegantly drops the need for runtime server components, relying fully on static assets and client-side rendering powered by modern web technologies.

## Why Dory Matters

Imagine you are a developer wrestling with slow documentation builds that require heavyweight frameworks and complicated deployment setups. Dory solves these pain points by offering:

- **Simplicity**: Just add your `.mdx` files and configure a single `dory.json` file — no complex build pipelines or server frameworks.
- **Speed**: Experience near-instant hot reload during development and fast static site generation for production.
- **Portability**: Generated sites are static, enabling easy deployment anywhere — from GitHub Pages to Netlify, Vercel, and custom servers.
- **Focused Developer Experience**: Built with Preact, Vite, and TypeScript for modern, efficient front-end workflows, making it easy to customize and extend.

By eliminating server-side rendering and external CI/CD dependencies, Dory lets you maintain full ownership and control over your documentation deployment without compromises.

## What Makes Dory Unique?

- **Developer-Centered Philosophy**: Designed from the ground up for developers creating technical documentation, meaning less friction and fewer abstractions.
  
- **Minimal Magic, Maximum Transparency**: The core is readable, hackable, and simple — no black-box components or hard-to-debug tools.

- **MDX Content First**: Supports `.mdx` files which combine Markdown and JSX, allowing you to mix prose with interactive React-like components effortlessly.

- **Embedded Tooling**: Comes with built-in UI components and utilities optimized for documentation use cases — code highlighting, Mermaid diagrams, API playgrounds, and more.

## How Dory Works at a High Level

At its core, Dory generates a fully static documentation website by:

1. **Processing `.mdx` Files:** Parses Markdown mixed with JSX components to create rich, interactive documentation pages.

2. **Building Navigation:** Uses a single configuration file, `dory.json`, to define the site structure, navigation tabs, and groups.

3. **Preloading Metadata:** Optimizes performance by preloading page metadata (frontmatter) to facilitate fast page loads and client-side search.

4. **Client-Side Rendering:** Uses a lightweight frontend stack — Preact and Vite — to hydrate static pages and enable features like instant navigation and embedded interactivity.

5. **Serving as Static Assets:** Outputs everything as static files that any web server or static deployment platform can host.

This approach trims unnecessary complexity and yields a blazing-fast documentation experience.

## Key Benefits of Using Dory

- **Lightning-Fast Development Feedback:** Changes to content or configuration reflect immediately with hot reload.

- **Effortless Deployment:** Static artifacts deploy to any hosting environment without server dependencies.

- **Improved Maintainability:** Simple, transparent tooling reduces ongoing maintenance overhead.

- **Rich Interactive Documentation:** Easily embed API playgrounds, Mermaid diagrams, and custom JSX components within your docs.

- **Seamless Integrations:** Native support for OpenAPI and AsyncAPI lets you wire API docs with interactive testing tools.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine your team needs to ship documentation alongside a continuously evolving API. Using Dory, you place your `.mdx` files alongside OpenAPI specs. When you start the dev server, you get instant previews of your docs — complete with interactive API request playgrounds — all without additional config.

When ready to publish, a single static build command produces a deployable site you can host anywhere.

This removes the common headaches of managing separate servers, complicated rendering setups, or long build times.

## How This Page Fits In

This introduction page lays the foundation for understanding Dory’s core purpose and the philosophy behind its design. It connects naturally with subsequent documentation pages covering:

- **Who Dory is For:** Identifying the ideal user profiles and practical use cases.
- **Core Concepts & Terminology:** Clarifying essential terms and architecture.
- **Feature Overview:** Detailing available components and capabilities.

By grasping the essence of Dory here, users are better prepared to explore configuration, setup, and customization in later sections.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin using Dory:

- Prepare your documentation content as `.mdx` files.
- Configure your site structure in the `dory.json` file.
- Run the development server with `pnpm run dev` to preview instantly.
- Build the static site using `pnpm run build` when ready to deploy.

For detailed setup instructions and a guided introduction, proceed to the Getting Started guides.

<Tip>
  Keep your documentation modular by organizing `.mdx` files logically and updating `dory.json` navigation to reflect site structure.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Slow or Unresponsive Development Server:** Ensure dependencies are installed correctly (`pnpm install`) and no port conflicts exist.

- **Navigation Entries Missing:** Verify your `dory.json` file is properly structured with valid tab, group, and page entries.

- **Static Build Fails:** Check for syntax errors in your `.mdx` files and ensure your build environment meets Node.js version requirements.

- **Dependencies Not Found:** Confirm `pnpm` usage as preferred package manager and that the lockfile is up to date.

## Code Snippet: Basic CLI Usage

```bash
# Build your documentation site
node bin/dory.js build

# Preview the built site locally
node bin/dory.js preview
```


## Example Site Structure (dory.json)

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Overview",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Introduction & Core Concepts",
            "pages": ["what-is-dory", "target-audience-use-cases", "core-concepts-terminology"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This defines a navigation tab "Overview" with a group "Introduction & Core Concepts" containing three pages.
